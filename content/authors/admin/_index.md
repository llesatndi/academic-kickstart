# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I focus my research on Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) and associated techniques such as data compression, low rank representation. I have recently set myself the goal to integrate deep learning features to ROM framework and solving PDEs.

interests:
- Reduced Order Modeling
- Low rank approximation and tensor reduction
- Deep Learning for PDEs
