abstract = {Numerical simulation has experienced tremendous improvements in the last decadesdriven by massive growth of computing power. Exascale computing has beenachieved this year and will allow solving ever more complex problems. But suchlarge systems produce colossal amounts of data which leads to its own difficulties.Moreover, many engineering problems such as multiphysics or optimisation andcontrol, require far more power that any computer architecture could achievewithin the current scientific computing paradigm. In this thesis, we proposeto shift the paradigm in order to break the curse of dimensionality byintroducing decomposition and building reduced order models (ROM) for complexfluid flows.This manuscript is organized into two parts. The first one proposes an extendedreview of data reduction techniques and intends to bridge between appliedmathematics community and the computational mechanics one. Thus, foundingbivariate separation is studied, including discussions on the equivalence ofproper orthogonal decomposition (POD, continuous framework) and singular valuedecomposition (SVD, discrete matrices). Then a wide review of tensor formats andtheir approximation is proposed. Such work has already been provided in theliterature but either on separate papers or into a purely applied mathematicsframework. Here, we offer to the data enthusiast scientist a comparison ofCanonical, Tucker, Hierarchical and Tensor train formats including theirapproximation algorithms. Their relative benefits are studied both theoreticallyand numerically thanks to the python library texttt{\{}pydecomp{\}} that wasdeveloped during this thesis. A {\ldots}},

abstract = {Flow inside a lid-driven cavity (LDC) is studied here to elucidate bifurcation sequences of the flow at super-critical Reynolds numbers (Recr1) with the help of analyzing the time series at most energetic points in the flow domain. The implication of Recr1 in the context of direct simulation of Navier-Stokes equation is presented here for LDC, with or without explicit excitation inside the LDC. This is aided further by performing detailed enstrophy-based proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the flow field. The flow has been computed by an accurate numerical method for two different uniform grids. POD of results of these two grids help us understand the receptivity aspects of the flow field, which give rise to the computed bifurcation sequences by understanding the similarity and differences of these two sets of computations. We show that POD modes help one understand the primary and secondary instabilities noted during the bifurcation sequences.},

@article{Sengupta2018,
abstract = {A new reduced order model (ROM) is proposed here for reconstructing super-critical flow past circular cylinder and lid driven cavity using time-scaling of vorticity data directly. The present approach is a significant improvement over instability-mode (developed from POD modes) based approach implemented in Sengupta et al. [Phys Rev E 91(4):043303, 2015], where governing Stuart--Landau--Eckhaus equations are solved. In the present method, we propose a novel ROM that uses relation between Strouhal number (St) and Reynolds number (Re). We provide a step by step approach for this new ROM for any Re and is a general procedure with vorticity data requiring very limited storage as well as being extremely fast. We emphasize on the scientific aspects of developing ROM by taking data from close proximity of the target Re to produce DNS-quality reconstruction, while the applied aspect is also shown. All the donor points need not be immediate neighbors and the reconstructed solution has equivalent relaxed accuracy. However, one would restrain the range where the flow behavior is coherent between donors. The reported work is a proof of concept utilizing the external and internal flow examples, and this can be extended for other flows characterized by appropriate Re--St data.},
