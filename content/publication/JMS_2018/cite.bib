abstract = {Flow inside a lid-driven cavity (LDC) is studied here to elucidate bifurcation sequences of the flow at super-critical Reynolds numbers (Recr1) with the help of analyzing the time series at most energetic points in the flow domain. The implication of Recr1 in the context of direct simulation of Navier-Stokes equation is presented here for LDC, with or without explicit excitation inside the LDC. This is aided further by performing detailed enstrophy-based proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the flow field. The flow has been computed by an accurate numerical method for two different uniform grids. POD of results of these two grids help us understand the receptivity aspects of the flow field, which give rise to the computed bifurcation sequences by understanding the similarity and differences of these two sets of computations. We show that POD modes help one understand the primary and secondary instabilities noted during the bifurcation sequences.},
