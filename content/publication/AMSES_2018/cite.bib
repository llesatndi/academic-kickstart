abstract = {A new reduced order model (ROM) is proposed here for reconstructing super-critical flow past circular cylinder and lid driven cavity using time-scaling of vorticity data directly. The present approach is a significant improvement over instability-mode (developed from POD modes) based approach implemented in Sengupta et al. [Phys Rev E 91(4):043303, 2015], where governing Stuart--Landau--Eckhaus equations are solved. In the present method, we propose a novel ROM that uses relation between Strouhal number (St) and Reynolds number (Re). We provide a step by step approach for this new ROM for any Re and is a general procedure with vorticity data requiring very limited storage as well as being extremely fast. We emphasize on the scientific aspects of developing ROM by taking data from close proximity of the target Re to produce DNS-quality reconstruction, while the applied aspect is also shown. All the donor points need not be immediate neighbors and the reconstructed solution has equivalent relaxed accuracy. However, one would restrain the range where the flow behavior is coherent between donors. The reported work is a proof of concept utilizing the external and internal flow examples, and this can be extended for other flows characterized by appropriate Re--St data.},
